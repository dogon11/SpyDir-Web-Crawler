Edit (4/22/20, Justin Maddox):

Changed this to upload my proof-of-concept program that enables the traversal and pulling of links in scrapy. Output everything to a .csv file by navigating to the root directory of the project (spydir_demo) and typing:

>scrapy crawl -o [filename].[file extension(.csv works)] linkspider
